There is no voice/audio to the video, sorry. I, Josh, was the only one available to create the video 
and I have been dealing with a hiccuping issue all day today and couldn't go more than a few seconds 
without hiccupping. The Video has title cards and a gameplay demo and highlights significant game events.
