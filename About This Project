This project was done for CIS 350 at GVSU by Josh Hubbard(Main Programmer: Logic and some GUI) and Jacob Fitzpatrick(GUI).

Due to the Coronavirus situation, among other things, team cooperation fell apart and the project was unable to be 
  completed further than its current state.

If finished, it would have had a much more polished GUI and it would have been more user playable instead of 
  having all major game events (property buying/selling/trading, mortgaging, Chance/Community Chest card system) be 
  handled automatically dependant on the current state of each player.
